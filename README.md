# Comparison of LSTM neural network architecture depending on BERT transformers based on the task of binary classification of sentiment reviews in Croatian
The goals of this work can be defined as:
  - research of important text preprocessing steps that affect the SA task,
  - examination of text representation based on the performance of SA model tasks using already trained multilingual models,
  - based on the classification measure, check the performance of the deep learning model,
  - checking if there is a significant difference in the results obtained by classification using word embedding models trained in the Croatian language compared to word embedding models trained in the English language.
